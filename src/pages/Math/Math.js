          <p>We offer five different mathematics course levels. Each course takes place in two parts: a fall "A" section, and a continuing spring "B" section. Note that the A section must be taken before the B section. The A section is only offered in the fall, and the B section is only offered in the spring. Each course teaches enrichment topics and content outside of the standard school curriculum. There is an emphasis on creative thinking, problem-solving, and competition math strategies. Each class will also feature fun brainteasers and logic puzzles. All courses will be largely problem-based, with a short lesson at the beginning. The goal of the Math Track is to equip students with the critical thinking and problem-solving skills that will help them succeed in middle school and beyond.</p>
